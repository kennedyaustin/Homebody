# Home Body Fitness
### This full stack web application helps you build and save workouts you can do at home! After login in, select one or more functional targets (push, pull, legs, core) and a workout will be generated for you. Then you can choose to save the workout to your profile. You can view all your saved workouts in one place and delete any that you don't want to keep.
